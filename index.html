          <p">Hello! My name is Ali Amirhamzeh. A few fun facts about me: I got married a few months ago. I've worked with technology for 8 plus years. Coding is an area that I have always been interested in and finally found the courage to pursue. I see this career path as something that will continue to grow and thrive in the future. I'm thrilled to be here at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> and, yet, also very nervous. There is so much to learn and I want excel at my job. Along with my interest in the tech world, I enjoy all sorts of video games, working on cars, playing sports, and working with computers. I've even built a couple PC's for myself and for other people. I'm looking forward to my time here!</p>
